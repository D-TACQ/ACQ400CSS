CSS GUI control for ACQ2006.

CSS opens by default in edit mode. 
You can set it to open in run mode every time:

Edit|Preferences..
CSS Applications|Display|BOY
set Top OPIs "/acq420_launcher.opi"

On recent versions of CSS : 3.2.11, the button press behaviour changed.
If all the buttons appear with a thin pink box, press the button once and 
the pink warning disappears, press again and the opi launches.

Or make it go away altogether:
Edit|Preferences|Display|BOY|OPI Runtime
Set PV Connection Layer to utility_pv
Check all four "Show" options.


PLEASE: ALWAYS USE THE LAUNCHER!
DO NOT RUN OPI's direct!


Creating Custom Strip Chart Plots:
To plot AI PV's on a strip chart:
- run ./scripts/make-ch-plt -h to start generating plot files.
- Open ./PLOTS/*.plt from the CSS Data Browser Navigator
